PATHWAY INTEGRATION

## ore Integration Points:

*1. Python Backend Streaming:*

- scripts/streaming_pipeline.py - Main Pathway streaming pipeline that processes CSV inventory data in real-time
- scripts/pricing_engine.py - Live pricing engine that integrates with Pathway streams to recalculate prices dynamically


*2. TypeScript Client Integration:*

- lib/pathway-client.ts - WebSocket client for connecting to Pathway streams with real-time product updates
- lib/live-data-manager.ts - Manages live data subscriptions and handles reconnection logic


*3. API Integration:*

- app/api/products/live/route.ts - Serves live product data from Pathway streams
- app/api/realtime-pricing/route.ts - Provides real-time pricing updates


*4. Documentation & Implementation:*

- docs/pathway-implementation-guide.ts - Complete 8-step implementation guide
- README_DEMO.md - Demo instructions including Pathway setup


The integration creates a complete real-time data pipeline: CSV inventory data flows through Pathway's streaming engine, triggers dynamic pricing calculations, and pushes updates to the frontend via WebSocket connections. The system automatically handles reconnections and provides fallback mechanisms when live data isn't available.
